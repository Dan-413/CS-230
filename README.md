Software Design Document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The client was The Gaming Room. They had a game called Draw It or Lose It for already running on Android. The client wanted to improve the software functionality and to expand to other platforms. I kept this document clear and concise with practical recommendations.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It aids in prioritizing tasks and making sure the right tasks are the point of focus at the right time.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Recomendations was difficult for me due to a lack of confidence in my expertise.  I would improve upon my detail in my explanations and comparisons in order to feel more confident in my recommendations.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took what the functionality of the game and helped split it up so that there would be less work and time spend expanding to other operating platforms. All while still keeping the game the same. The user is the one the product is truly being created for, and without the user there is no need for the product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I put my focus on clear documentation and separating game functionality and scaleability to make expansion to other operating platforms in the future easier.
